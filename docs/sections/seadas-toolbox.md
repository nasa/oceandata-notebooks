# About SeaDAS - OCSSW

Learn to use the SeaDAS (Sea, earth and atmosphere Data Analysis System) processing tools for comprehensive ocean color data analysis. SeaDAS is the official NASA software package that incorporates OCSSW (Ocean Color Science SoftWare), a collection of command-line processing algorithms and utilities used by the ocean color community worldwide. OCSSW provides the core computational engine that powers SeaDAS, containing standardized algorithms for atmospheric correction, bio-optical retrievals, and data product generation. While SeaDAS offers both a graphical desktop application and command-line interface, OCSSW can be used independently for automated processing workflows, making it ideal for batch processing large datasets and integration into custom analysis pipelines.

## What you'll learn:
- [SeaDAS Desktop Application Resources](../sections/seadas-desktop.md) - Resources and tutorials for using the SeaDAS graphical interface
- [Install SeaDAS Processors](../notebooks/oci/oci_ocssw_install.md) - Setting up OCSSW command-line processing tools
- [Basic Processing](../notebooks/oci/oci_ocssw_processing_overview.md) - Getting started with OCSSW processing workflows
- [Generate Level-2 Products](../notebooks/oci/oci_ocssw_l2gen.md) - Creating Level-2 data products from raw satellite data
- [Run the GIOP Algorithm](../notebooks/oci/oci_ocssw_giop.md) - Implementing the Generalized Inherent Optical Property algorithm
