    "## 2. Cloud Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud masking refers to the task of assigning a binary value to each pixel in a satellite image, according to whether or not that location is covered by a cloud. It is essential to many other data products. For non-atmospheric scientists, this is usually useful to know what pixels to ignore, or 'mask out', in processing. For atmospheric scientists, it is often the opposite: we may exclusively wish to study the clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud mask data we will use today comes from the PACE data, and is itself already the product of a machine learning algorithm. Normally, you wouldn't recreate the output of a machine learning algorithm with another machine learning algorithm (that takes the exact same inputs), but this will serve fine for the purposes of our tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have pre-processed the cloud mask data and associated OCI imagery into an easy-to-use dataset. We have taken OCI granules and chopped them up into 64x64 patches. The inputs include 11 of the OCI bands from the visible to the near-infrared: 413, 442, 470, 550, 650, 865, 940, 1249, 1378, 1618, and 2131 nm. The inputs also include a land vs. sea mask, which will be useful information for our model. The output is the binary cloud mask. Since there are 12 inputs, we have split each image into 3-channel groups to be able to save them as PNG files. Along with the inputs and output, we include the associated validity mask, which indicates whether each pixel is valid for processing. These files are all already stored here on the server, located in the path specified above in the CLDMASK_PATH variable.\n",

    "## 3. Training, Validation, and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a machine learning algorithm, it's important to understand how your model generalizes to data it hasn't been directly trained on. It's also important to understand how your particular choices of designing that model will generalize to data that you haven't tuned those choices for. For that reason, it is standard practice to divide your data into a training, validation, and test sets. The purpose of the training set is to fit your model. Your model will be directly supervised on that data. The purpose of the validation set is to allow you to figure out how to improve your model's design. The model parameters should NOT be fit to the validation data. Your hyperparameters (e.g. how many layers in your neural network, the learning rate, the type of data augmentation) are optimized with respect to the validation set. In other words, while you're making decisions about how to design your model, the validation set is what you base those decisions on. Finally, the test set is the last thing you use. You shouldn't make any changes (to parameters or hyperparameters) after seeing your results on the test set. Oftentimes, the maintainers of benchmark datasets will not provide labels for the testing set. To get their results, participants will send their predictions to maintainers of the benchmark, who will themselves evaluate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the training set is for fitting parameters, the validation set is for fitting hyperparameters, and the test set is for fitting NOTHING. You can split up your data in lots of different ways, but you typically want your training set to be the largest set, allowing your model to see the greatest diversity of data possible. The validation and test set should only be as big as is necessary to give you an accurate evaluation of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Normally, you want to make sure you're not accidentally \"cheating\" by sampling your train/val/test from the same distribution. For example, you wouldn't want the same granule to yield patches in two different sets. You might want to enforce even stricter requirements on your splits, like having a test set from a different season than the rest of your data, to show that your method generalizes to any time of year. For simplicity's sake, we will be ignoring these good practices, and sampling our patches randomly, regardless of what granule they're from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common practice which we will ignore is called \"cross validation\", where you generate multiple train/val splits, fitting your model independently to each one, to get an understanding of the variance between different splits of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`generate_split` will generate a random training/validation/test \"split\" and save it to a JSON file. Go ahead and run it. Careful, as if you've already run this function before with the same split name, it will throw a ValueError, unless you add \"replace=True\" to the function call."

In the case where one of the images won't load, we return arrays filled with zeros. Since the validity mask will be all zero, our code will be able to handle this appropriately later.\n",

    "## 5. A Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's design a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the simplest form of neural network. MLPs consist of fully-connected layers, also known as [linear layers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html), separated by activation functions. Fully-connected simply means that, within a layer, every input is connected to every output. Let $M$ be the number of inputs to a linear layer, and let $N$ be the number of outputs. Let $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times N}$ be the weight matrix. Let $b\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be an optional bias vector. The output $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$ of a linear layer, given input $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$, is defined as $y=xW + b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An MLP consists of several linear layers. The output of one layer is processed by an activation function before feeding into the next layer. This activation function must be a non-linear function! Otherwise, no matter how many layers we add to our network, it will always be reducible to a single linear layer. Historically, the activation function of choice was sigmoid, as it (loosely) resembles the activation patterns of human neurons, and it constraints output to lie between 0 and 1. In practice, researchers discovered that this doesn't work well in deeper networks, and it contributes to the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem). In practice, the [rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html), or variants, works better. Let's plot both below:"

    "Well, an optimizer of course! Neural networks are typically trained via gradient-based optimization. This means that we use our loss function to compute the gradient (vector version of a derivative) of each parameter in our network with respect to the loss. Since the entire forward process, including the linear layers, activation functions, and loss function, is _differentiable_, we can use the chain rule to determine the gradient of any parameter in our model. This process of going backwards through the network computing gradients is known as [\"backpropagation.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)\n",
    "\n",
    "These gradients give us the direction in which to nudge each parameter in order to lower the loss function. We can update each parameter with a step in that direction every time we see a new batch. We multiply the gradient with a hyperparameter called the \"step size\", alternatively referred to as the \"learning rate\". A larger step size will cause the model to update more quickly, but if it's too large, the model might keep overshooting the best location. A common practice is to gradually decrease the step size over the course of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to compute the loss (and the gradient) for the entire dataset at once, then take an optimization step, then this technique would be known as \"gradient descent.\" When we divide our data up into batches and take a step on each batch, it's known as \"stochastic gradient descent\" (SGD). This is because the loss/gradient is more erratic/random/stochastic with smaller batches. Still, SGD is typically better than gradient descent, as it's much faster: we don't have to iterate through our entire dataset each time we make an update. Also, a little bit of stochasticity can help to escape local minima during optimization.\n",

Under the hood, torch will build a computation graph for the operations you use. [More details about autograd here.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html) This is also why torch arrays are called \"tensors.\" A tensor is like an array, but its storage can also keep track of its gradient.

If we were to use our simple MLP model from above on an entire image, it would mean that, instead of 12 inputs, each instance would have $12 \\times 64 \\times 64 = 49152$ inputs. And our images are pretty small. You can easily imagine how crazy this would get for a $1000\\times1000$ image, or even a 4K image. Not only will this be really slow, but it also means that our network will have to learn _extremely redundant_ features, because it will have to re-learn what a cloud looks like _in every pixel of the image_.\n",

    "You can see how with some very simple kernels, we are able to achieve interesting transformations of the input image. Hopefully you can imagine how, with a variety of kernels, you could extract quite a lot of useful information out of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network is composed of multiple layers, where each layer is represented by convolutional kernels that are applied to the inputs with this same sliding window process. Unlike the simple examples shown above, a convolutional layer usually has multiple input and output channels. You can think of convolutional layers as being fully connected in the _channel dimension_, and convolutional in the _spatial dimensions_. The [documentation on `torch.nn.Conv2d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) is helpful if you want more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few more important points about 2D convs to keep in mind:\n",
    "- Convolutional layers should still be separated by non-linear activation functions, or you'll end up with the same reduction-to-linearity problem described earlier.\n",
    "- CNNs almost always use 3x3 kernels, as stacking multiple 3x3 layers works better than using one layer with a larger kernel dimension\n",
    "- There is still an optional (but typically used) bias term in convolutional layers, just like in linear layers\n",
    "- A convolutional layer will slightly crop the input image (by kernel_size - 1) unless you apply padding to the input\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's design a simple CNN. Instead of using `torch.nn.Sequential`, we'll create a class that implements `torch.nn.Module`, which gives us more fine-grained control over the design of our model. To do this, we only have to implement `__init__` and `forward`, which gets called when you apply the model to some input. We'll start with only 10 layers, which are all 3x3 kernels with an intermediate feature depth of 16. We'll set padding to 1 to avoid shrinking the image dimensions at the boundaries. Using 10 layers is a good starting point - if we used too many layers we'd have to start thinking more carefully about how the gradients propagate through those layers (see the [ResNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) if you'd like to know more).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice we're also adding our ReLU activations, like before, and also batch normalization layers. The original [batchnorm paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) is a good read, but the TL;DR is that it will make our training faster."
