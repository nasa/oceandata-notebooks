    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing a whole collection of Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) granules, or even big subsets of that collection,\n",
    "requires breaking up one big job into many small jobs. That and putting the pieces back together again. The reason we\n",
    "break up big jobs has to do with computational resources, specifically memory (i.e. RAM) and processors (i.e. CPUs or GPUs).\n",
    "That big collection of OCI granules can't all fit in memory; and even if it could, your computation might only use one\n",
    "of several available processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works towards a better understanding of a tool tightly integrated with XArray that is designed to handle the\n",
    "challenges of effectively creating and managing these jobs. The tool is [Dask: a Python library for parallel and distributed computing][dask].\n",
    "Before diving into Dask, the notebook gets started with an even more foundational concept for performant computing: using\n",
    "compiled functions that are typically not even written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The importance of using high-performance functions to do array operations\n",
    "- How to start a `dask` client for parallel and larger-than-memory pipelines\n",
    "- One method for interpolating Level-2 \"swath\" data to a map projection\n",
